Hello guy,
I will guide u how to run my project.
First, u will check your java version. Come Command Prompt(cmd) and type 'java -version'.
If it displays the 'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command, your computer did not have
any versions of the java. U need to install The Java Standard Edition.
-> Type jdk in google search and in first link, U can install the lastest jdk.( I use 17.0.2 version)
The most common error is u dont set the environmental variable.
To fix this error, u have to find the javac app in the file u just installed and copy this path.
After that, u go to This PC then properties, check the advanced properties, select the environmental
variable. Carefully! Follow me!. U choose New user variables and write the variable name (path) and variable
value by the path u just copied.  After that, u can check by using the 'javac -version' in cmd.
Second, U need to install eclipse (its up to u). Go to the https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ and install
the lastest version.
After the download is completed. Run this then press in eclipse IDE for Jave Developers(accept the 
agreement)
